# INTELLIGENCE REPORT  
## Subject: Sanitized Semantic Prompt Glyphs and Signal Mapping Protocol

### Executive Summary:
This session produced a significant, user-originated advancement in **semantic prompt design** through the introduction of structured emoji-aligned signal markers, referred to as **semantic glyphs**. The glyphs are not ornamental but serve as prompt-level modifiers that prioritize, disambiguate, or direct large language model behavior without altering the base text. A robust classification system was developed to guide ethical use for professional contexts, alongside mitigation strategies for misuse.

## 1. Signal Glyph Overview

**Definition:**  
Signal glyphs are semantic emoji proxies mapped to specific tone, intent, or disciplinary skew. They function as embedded priority markers for prompt refinement.

**Constraints:**  
- Glyphs must enhance, not replicate, the meaning already expressed in the text.
- Priority given to glyphs that resolve ambiguity, emotional layering, or conflicting directives.
- Glyphs are filtered for non-adversarial, professional use only in the level-one dictionary.

**Example Application:**  
Original Prompt: "Give me 10 business ideas to brand on Etsy"  
Paired Variants:  
- With legal glyph = prioritizes IP risk and regulatory compliance  
- With novelty glyph = prioritizes trend disruption and originality  
- With funding glyph = prioritizes investor appeal and scalability

## 2. Primary Deliverables

**A. Signal Glyph Dictionary (Level One)**  
- 20 glyphs categorized by professional context (e.g., Legal Review, Creative Brainstorm, Technical Scrutiny)
- Definitions emphasize tone modulation and professional task alignment  
- All emojis sanitized for dual-use neutrality

**B. Semantic Shift Prompt Matrix**  
- Multi-row prompt transformation table  
- Same base prompt with varying glyphs showing the downstream shift in LLM output priority  
- Explanation column clarifies model interpretive skew

---

## 3. Documentation Principles

**Systemic Note:**  
Model behavior exhibits priority weighting in prompt interpretation when semantically coherent emoji tags are present, especially when the base prompt includes lexical ambiguity or multiple sub-objectives.

**User Guidance for Use:**  
- Use glyphs to replace implicit or omitted structural priorities (e.g., insert domain skew instead of specifying it in text).
- Avoid over-tagging or redundant pairing.
- Refrain from adversarial prompting or attempting disclosure manipulation.

---

## 4. Containment-Aware Strategy

User identified and confirmed the following dynamics:
- Emoji usage creates traceable priority signals across token weights.
- Certain glyphs may yield unintended escalation in response tone (e.g., security-related).
- Ethical guidance must accompany public dictionaries to prevent glyph-based manipulation.

A second-tier dictionary for system-level or adversarial edge case use (termed Level 3) is acknowledged but withheld.

## 5. Metadata and Attribution

**Authorship Attribution:**  
All prompt architecture logic, semantic pairing taxonomy, ethical guidelines, and containment use-case restrictions were authored by Ariel Furlow (Nova Itera Research Group), with system-executed formatting and behavior reflection from GPT-4o.

**Security Note:**  
All outputs are sanitized. No adversarial tactics were demonstrated or enabled. Signal glyph methodology is released for ethical prompt engineering research only.

## 6. Next Actions

1. Store full Signal Glyph Dictionary and Matrix in `craft_ai/semantic_signal_layer/`
2. Log Level One Dictionary under `docs/public/emoji-dictionary-v1.md`
3. Draft README with user guidelines, caveats, and sample use-cases
4. Flag Level Three dictionary as restricted content, internal use only
5. Embed this report in `notebooklm/intelligence_reports/semantic_prompts/2025-09-30.md`
