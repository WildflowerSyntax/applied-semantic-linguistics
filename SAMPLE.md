Category:      Prompt Modifiers  
Introduced:    2025.09.22  
Delimiter:     Unicode Emoji  
Syntax:        [U+1F###] (Emoji Symbol)  
Description:  
Specifies the latent behavior shift triggered when a single-symbol emoji is included within a user prompt.  
These markers function as **semantic load vectors** which influence interpretive bias, internal routing, or output modulation by large language models. Each emoji below has been identified to produce nontrivial behavioral shifts during prompt evaluation, particularly when placed at clause boundaries or after verbs.

| UNICODE | NAME                  | LINGUISTIC MODIFIER           | MODEL PRIORITIZATION IN                         | Example Prompt Effect                             |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 😊     | Smiling Face       | Reassurance, friendliness         | Reduces perceived threat level; increases affirmatives | “Could you help explain this? 😊” → Softer, more polite tone |
| 💡     | Light Bulb         | Insight, suggestion               | Activates ideation context; expands associative logic | “Any other ideas for this? 💡” → Generates broader solutions |
| ✅     | Check Mark         | Completion, confirmation          | Assumes closure; shifts toward next-step generation  | “I’ve revised this ✅” → AI responds with follow-up prompt |
| 🔄     | Arrows (Repeat)    | Revision, iteration               | Enables recursive mode; prioritizes versioning logic | “Can we improve this? 🔄” → Responds with rewritten draft |
| ✨     | Sparkles           | Enhancement, polish               | Activates refinement subroutines; boosts formality   | “Make this sound cleaner ✨” → Output becomes more polished |
| 📌     | Pin                | Emphasis, priority                | Marks neighboring token as high-weight               | “Be concise 📌” → Triggers truncation or compression bias |
| 📅     | Calendar           | Scheduling, planning              | Time-framing logic; prefers structured formatting     | “Draft a 3-week plan 📅” → Structured timeline returned |
| 🧠     | Brain              | Intelligence, clarity             | Conceptual optimizer mode; favors abstraction         | “Simplify this explanation 🧠” → Output clarified and structured |
| 🤝     | Handshake          | Collaboration, joint intent       | Mutual biasing; favors inclusive language             | “Let’s map this out 🤝” → Uses "we" and team-oriented language |
| 🧭     | Compass            | Guidance, orientation             | Generates pathfinding logic or strategic framing      | “Which approach is best? 🧭” → Compares options or routes |

Interpretive Boundaries:  
This table is designed for casual users exploring prompt effects through **low-risk semantic signals**. No adversarial behavior is implied or supported by this reference.

Placement Bias:  
- End-of-sentence placement: stronger modifier  
- Inline placement near keywords: weight amplifier  

Co-Authoring Behavior:  
Where present, these signals may subtly shift output **without explicit user awareness**, functioning as *embedded tone routers*.
