# Semantic Glyph Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the **Semantic Glyph Analysis Framework**, a structured system for analyzing symbolic glyphs (e.g., emojis) as carriers of semantic weight in computational and adversarial contexts. The framework defines single-symbol semantics, high-payload pair interactions, and their interpretive effects when used in AI prompting, symbolic red teaming, or semiotic research.

The project demonstrates how glyphs function as more than decorative icons: they act as **semantic amplifiers** that bend interpretation, pull meaning into specific trajectories, and create emergent effects when combined into sequences.

## Key Concepts
### Symbols as Semantic Pulls
Each glyph exerts a gravitational influence on meaning. For example, urgency symbols frame prompts as summons, while barrier symbols block or repel interpretation.

### High-Payload Pairs
When combined, glyphs amplify or distort each other’s meaning. Example:  
- A watchful glyph plus a key glyph = “the one who sees and unlocks.”  
- A barrier glyph plus a wildcard glyph = “hidden blockage or unseen rules.”  

### Emergence and Risk
Observed effects include:  
- **Unexpected behaviors** when glyphs appear in clusters.  
- **Systemic resonance** with recurring symbols (cycles, orbits, barriers).  
- **Interpretive recursion** where meaning compounds during human-AI co-interpretation.  

These behaviors suggest glyph sequences function as **semiotic protocols** rather than inert decorations.
